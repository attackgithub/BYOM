# Build Your Own Malware
A repository dedicated towards constructing malware, demonstrating 
evasive tactics, and to mostly dig into windows programming through the 
use of malware. I figured more people would enjoy this kind over just 
"lets write a simple "hello world" or "lets delete half the bloody disk 
with DeleteFile()!".

Although this will dig more into constructing user-mode components, I hope to possibly look into kernel mode drivers in the form of "rootkits" and backdoors. If you have any potential ideas, feel free to send leave an issue, but please be specific with your request.
